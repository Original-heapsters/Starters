The office bathroom is becoming something ridiculous. There is literally poop that is smeared along the walls. The toilets are turning yellow from all the pee that has been sprayed on it. How do I even go poop if I can't even sit on the toilet. I have to walk to the restaurant across the street to even use the restroom. Toilets should not be turning yellow. Toilets should be clean. ,"{'negatives': [], 'positives': [{'original_length': 23, 'sentiment': 'clean', 'documentIndex': 6, 'score': 0.519, 'normalized_length': 23, 'topic': 'toilets', 'normalized_text': 'toilets should be clean', 'original_text': 'toilets should be clean'}]}",0.519,"even, even use, office bathroom, Toilets should be clean., becoming something ridiculous., smeared along, Toilets, Toilets should, restaurant across, turning yellow., t even sit, sprayed, poop, literally poop, smeared along the walls., walk to the restaurant across","d, i, c, t, _, v, a, l, u, e, s, (, [, 3, ,,  , 1, ,,  , 1, ,,  , 1, ,,  , 1, ,,  , 1, ,,  , 4, ,,  , 2, ,,  , 1, ,,  , 2, ,,  , 1, ,,  , 1, ,,  , 2, ,,  , 1, ,,  , 1, ,,  , 1, ], )",20161211_071859,1234,dev
