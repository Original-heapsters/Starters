"The concept of algorithm has existed for centuries; however, a partial formalization of what would become the modern algorithm began with attempts to solve the Entscheidungsproblem (the ""decision problem"") posed by David Hilbert in 1928. Subsequent formalizations were framed as attempts to define ""effective calculability""[8] or ""effective method"";[9] those formalizations included the Gödel–Herbrand–Kleene recursive functions of 1930, 1934 and 1935, Alonzo Church'
